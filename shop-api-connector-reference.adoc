The Shop API Connector is an Operation Based Connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Shop API Connector will support 3 different types of configuration and the details are given below.

[[PatchOrdersPaymentInstrumentsByOrderNoPaymentInstrumentId]]
== Patch Orders By IDPayment Instruments By ID

Updates a payment instrument of an order and passes the order and updated payment instrument to the correct payment authorizeCreditcard or authorize hook. Details: The payment instrument is updated with the provided details. The payment method must be applicable for the order see GET /baskets/{basket_id}/payment_methods, if the payment method is 'CREDIT_CARD' a payment_card must be specified in the request. 

The default implementation places the order if the order status is CREATED and the authorization amount equals or exceeds the order total. Placing the order (equivalent to calling dw.order.OrderMgr.placeOrder(order : Order) in the scripting API) results in the order being changed to status NEW and prepared for export.

[[CreateBaskets]]
== Post Baskets
`<shop:create-baskets>`


Creates a new basket. The created basket is initialized with default values. Data provided in the body document will be populated into the created basket. It can be updated with further Shop API calls. 

Considered values from the request body are: 

. Customer information: PUT /baskets/{basket_id}/customer 
. Billing address: PUT /baskets/{basket_id}/billing_address 
. Shipments including shipping address and shipping method: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/shipments 
. Product items: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/items 
. Coupon items: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/coupons 
. Gift certificate items: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/gift_certificates 
. Payment method and card type: POST /baskets/{basket_id}/payment_instruments 
. Custom properties: PATCH /baskets/{basket_id} 

Related resource means with which resource you can specify the same data after the basket creation. Identify the basket using the basket_id property, which should be integrated into the path of an update request, for example, a POST to /baskets/{basket_id}/items. The resource supports JWT or OAuth tokens for authentication: A customer must provide a JWT, which specifies exactly one customer (it may be a guest or a registered customer). In this case, the resource creates a basket for this customer. 

An agent must provide an OAuth token. The agent can use this resource to create a basket for a newly created guest customer, and can later update the customer if desired. The number of baskets that can be created per customer is limited. When a basket is created it is said to be open. It remains open until either order is created from it using a POST to resource /orders or it is deleted using a DELETE to resource /baskets/{basket_id}. The number of open baskets allowed depends on the authentication method used: When using JWT each customer can have just one open basket When using OAuth each customer can have up to 4 open baskets (this is a quota setting which can be updated by support) This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /baskets endpoint

[[CreateOrderSearch]]
== Post Order Search
`<shop:create-order-search>`


Searches for orders. The query attribute specifies a complex query that can be used to narrow down the search. Note that search fields are mandatory now and no default ones are supported. As the old order search version, the new one always uses Search Service too and for that reason Order Incremental Indexing should be enabled. Otherwise HTTP 500 response will occur. 

The supported search fields are: 

. Aaffiliate_partner_i_d 

. Affiliate_partner_name 

. Business_type 

. Channel_type 

. Confirmation_status (String) 

. Created_by 

. Creation_date 

. Currency_code

. Customer_email 

. Customer_name 

. Customer_no 

. Export_after 

. Export_status (String) 

. External_order_no 

. External_order_status 

. Global_party_id 

. Last_modified 

. Order_no 

. Original_order_no 

. Payment_status (String) 

. Replaced_order_no 

. Replacement_order_no 

. Shipping_status (String) 

. Status (String) 

. Total_gross_price 

. Total_net_price 

. Order.has_holds 

. Coupon_line_items 

. Coupon_code 

. Coupon_line_items

. Coupon_id holds

. Type invoices

. Status order_items

. Status payment_instruments

. Credit_card_type 

. Payment_instruments : Payment_method_id 

. Product_items : Product_id 

. Return_cases : Return_case_number

. Shipments : Shipping_method_id 

. shipping_orders: shipping_order_number 

The sort order of the retrieved orders could be specified by the "sorts" parameter. It is a list of objects presenting field name and sort direction ("asc" or "desc"). Custom attributes could be used as search fields and as sort fields too. A prefix "c_" has to be added to them. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /order_search endpoint

[[CreateOrdersPaymentInstrumentsByOrderNo]]
== Post Orders By IDPayment Instruments
`<shop:create-orders-payment-instruments-by-order-no>`


Adds a payment instrument to an order. It is possible either to supply the full payment information or only a customer payment instrument id and amount. In case the customer payment instrument id was set all the other properties (except amount) are ignored and the payment data is resolved from the stored customer payment information. An attempt is made to authorize the order by passing it to the authorize or authorizeCreditCard hook. Details: The payment instrument is added with the provided details or the details from the customer payment instrument. 

The payment method must be applicable for the order see GET /baskets/{basket_id}/payment_methods, if the payment method is 'CREDIT_CARD' a payment_card must be specified in the request. 

The default implementation places the order if the order status is CREATED and the authorization amount equals or exceeds the order total. Placing the order (equivalent to calling dw.order.OrderMgr.placeOrder(order : Order) in the scripting API) results in the order being changed to status NEW and prepared for export. This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /orders/{order_no}/payment_instruments endpoint

[[CreateSessions]]
== Post Sessions
`<shop:create-sessions>`


Exchanges a valid JWT into a new session, which is associated with the authenticated or anonymous customer. All Set-Cookie headers for handling the session are applied on the response. Only the JWT is used to create the new session. Any session IDs included in the request are ignored. Once you create a session from a JWT, you can use it in parallel with stateless OCAPI calls that use the JWT. There is no need to call the bridging resources again. If the customer is authenticated and has a storefront basket, that basket is transferred into the session and can be retrieved using BasketMgr.getCurrentBasket(), along with sensitive data such as addresses and payment information. This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /sessions endpoint
