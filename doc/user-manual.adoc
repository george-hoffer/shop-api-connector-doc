== About Shop-api

The Open Commerce API (OCAPI) enables you to access resources using HTTP requests and HTTP responses. Each resource is addressed by its unique URL, which includes the API version. Data is transported using request or header parameters, or within the request body as a JSON document with a defined structure. OCAPI is divided into different APIs: the Shop API allows a client to interact with the system as a shop customer or as an agent shopping on behalf of a customer, the Data API gives Create, Read, Update and Delete access to system resources, and the Meta API is used to retrieve a formal description of the Open Commerce API, including custom attributes.

== â€‹To Create a Mule Project in Anypoint Studio 7
The shop-api connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Below is the "Get Promotions" operation for better understanding

* Create new Mule Application in Studio and configure *HTTP Listener* to port 8080.

image::https://github.com/Apisero-Connectors/shop-api-Connector-doc/blob/master/doc/images/demo-get-promotions/HttpListneronfig.png[]
* Add "/getPromotions" path to test the flow.

image::https://github.com/Apisero-Connectors/shop-api-Connector-doc/blob/master/doc/images/demo-get-promotions/getPromotionsListnerpath.png[]
* Select *'Get Promotions'* operation from shop-api connector, drag & drop it into canvas. Click on Get Promotions operation.

image::https://github.com/Apisero-Connectors/Connector-doc/blob/master/doc/images/demo-get-promotions/getPromotionsParametersWithoutValue.png[]
* Select Client Id Conf from drop down which was already configured previously in global elements, or if required new configuration can be added by clicking green plus (+) symbol.

image::https://github.com/Apisero-Connectors/shop-api-Connector-doc/blob/master/doc/images/demo-get-promotions/ClientIdConfigGlobalElement.png[]
* Make sure to test your connection, if you have add new connection details.
* Enter user details for *Get Promotions* operation and save.

image::https://github.com/Apisero-Connectors/shop-api-Connector-doc/blob/master/doc/images/demo-get-promotions/getPromotionsParametersWithValue.png[]

* Save the Mule project.
* Complete flow looks as below.

image::https://github.com/Apisero-Connectors/shop-api-Connector-doc/blob/master/doc/images/demo-get-promotions/getPromitionsFlow.png[]
* Run the project as a Mule Application by right-clicking the project name in the Package Explorer, selecting Run As > Mule Application.
* Open Postman and check the response after entering the URL *http://localhost:8080/getPromotions*. You should see the cart details with same user.


=== To Create a Mule Project Using XML
