The shop-api connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Below is the "Get Promotions" operation for better understanding

* Create new Mule Application in Studio and configure *HTTP Listener* to port 8080.
