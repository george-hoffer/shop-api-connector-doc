=== â€‹Use case for creating a custoemr after submitting an order in Anypoint Studio 7
The Shop API Connector is an Operation Based Connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Below is the use case for *Creating Customer after Submitting an Order* operation for better understanding.

In this use case we are explaining the scenario how a Guest user will login into Shop API and creating a basket with products and shopping details. After successfull submition of order we will register the guest user as a customer. Here is the detailed information of each step for your reference.

* Create new Mule Application in Studio and configure *HTTP Listener* to port 8081.
