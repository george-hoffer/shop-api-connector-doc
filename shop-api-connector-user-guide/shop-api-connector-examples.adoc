=== â€‹Use case for creating a custoemr after submitting an order in Anypoint Studio 7
The Shop API Connector is an Operation Based Connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform. Shop API Connector will support 3 different types of configuration and here in this example we are using the Customer Auth Connection Provider configuration. Below is the use case for Creating Customer after Submitting an Order for better understanding.

In this use case we are explaining the scenario how a guest user will login into Shop API and submit a basket with products and shopping details. After successfull submition of order we will register the guest user as a customer. Here is the detailed information of each step for your reference.

1. Create new Mule Application in Studio and configure HTTP Listener to port 8081 and path as "/registrationPostCheckout".
