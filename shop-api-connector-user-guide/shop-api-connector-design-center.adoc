Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use the Design Center,
work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have
a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design
environment].
For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer
Tour].
To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.  
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.
