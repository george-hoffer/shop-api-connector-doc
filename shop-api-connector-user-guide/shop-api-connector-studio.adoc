 Also you can use Shop Api connector in Anypoint Studio by adding it as a dependency in your Mule application.

. Open your Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add the connector as a dependency in the pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
    <artifactId>shop-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-alpha</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which
you can click to install the update. After updating, update Maven pom.xml file dependencies to the new version.
